A minimal terminal coding agent harness in Go — a sibling to Pi.

- **Sub-agents** — spawn isolated jobs and watch the full run unfold in the TUI / job logs, without stuffing every turn into the parent context
- **Hashline edits** — edit by whole-file `@file path#TAG` plus line `LINE#HASH` anchors (same idea as [oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi)): the model points at anchors instead of rewriting whole files; stale tags/hashes are rejected so over-edits and silent corruption stop here
- **Permission gate** — Gate / Ask before destructive tools fire; safety is not optional when an agent can touch your tree
- **MCP without context death** — configure as many MCP servers as you want; their tool schemas **never** enter the model prompt. The system prompt lists **server names** only (like the Skills catalog); the agent uses three meta-tools (`mcp_list` / `mcp_inspect` / `mcp_call`) to discover and call on demand. Same Gate / Ask / Hooks path as built-in tools. See [MCP](#mcp)
- **Any model** — OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic, no vendor lock-in

## Quick start

Install the latest release (macOS / Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapatel0/alpha/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Windows (PowerShell 5.1+):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapatel0/alpha/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

First launch needs a model. Open the config editor (creates `~/.alpha` layout
and writes `~/.alpha/config.yaml`):

```sh
alpha config
```

Or set env vars for a one-off run:

```sh
export ALPHA_MODEL=gpt-4o
export ALPHA_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Then start the TUI:

```sh
alpha
```

Or log in with a subscription instead of an API key:

```sh
alpha login anthropic   # Claude Pro/Max (browser)
alpha login codex       # ChatGPT Codex (device code)
```

Tokens are stored in `~/.alpha/auth.json`. A model entry can omit `api_key` when a matching login exists. `models[].api_key` and `ALPHA_API_KEY` still win when set.

Also: `alpha login xai` (SuperGrok device code) and `alpha login gemini` (AI Studio key), or `XAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Pi package analogs are listed in [doc/plugins.md](doc/plugins.md).

Or build from source (Go 1.26.3+, see `go.mod`):

```sh
make build          # produces ./alpha
make install        # build and install into $GOBIN
```

On first start, alpha automatically creates `~/.alpha/{bin,skills,hooks,session}`. Search
tools (`fd`, `rg`) download into `~/.alpha/bin` in the background when missing.

The TUI gives the model four core tools — `read`, `write`, `edit`, and
`bash` — plus `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `read_image`, `skill`, `webfetch`,
and `websearch`. Search uses the current provider's native API when it
has one, otherwise DuckDuckGo.

## Footprint

alpha aims to stay cheap to run and cheap to hack on. Numbers below are for a
stripped release build (`CGO_ENABLED=0`, `-ldflags="-s -w"`), measured on
macOS arm64 unless noted.

| Metric | alpha |
| --- | ---: |
| Release binary | **~12 MB** |
| Idle RSS (1 session) | **~21 MB** |
| 10 idle sessions (total RSS) | **~196 MB** (~20 MB each) |
| Time to first frame | **~40 ms** (27–65 ms) |
| Cold `go build` (empty `GOCACHE`) | **~5.5 s** |
| Warm rebuild | **~0.7 s** |
| Go source (excl. tests) | **~22k LOC** / 107 files |
| Go packages | **32** |
| Direct module deps | **6** (15 modules total) |
| Linked runtimes | system libs only (no Node / Electron / Python) |

## Configuration

alpha reads `~/.alpha/config.yaml` (standard YAML). Environment variables
override it for one-off runs. `alpha config` opens an HTML editor for the same
file in your browser.

![alpha config](assets/config.png)

```yaml
# ~/.alpha/config.yaml
models:
  - name: gpt-4o            # model name; "claude-*" routes to the Anthropic API
    api_key: sk-...         # or set ALPHA_API_KEY
    base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1   # default; ALPHA_BASE_URL overrides
    context_window: 128000  # optional
    default: true           # the model used at startup; first entry wins if absent
  - name: claude-sonnet-4-20250514   # extra models; switchable at runtime
    api_key: sk-ant-...
    base_url: https://api.anthropic.com
    context_window: 200000

`alpha login anthropic` / `codex` / `xai` / `gemini` also adds that provider's
models to the TUI palette (Ctrl+K → settings → model) without editing this
file. Opening the model list fetches live IDs from each provider's `/models`
API (catalog fallback if the request fails). `ALPHA_MODEL_LIST=0` skips the
network. Config `api_key` still wins over OAuth.

skill_path: ~/.alpha/skills # where SKILL.md files are loaded from

agents:
  enabled: true           # default; set false to disable agent_* sub-agent tools

permissions:
  mode: interactive       # interactive | readonly | autopilot | headless-strict
  bash:
    default: ask          # ask | allow | deny
    allow:
      - "go test ./..."
    deny:
      - "rm -rf *"
```

### Recommended model: DeepSeek Flash

alpha + DeepSeek Flash — the best pairing: grounded, low hallucination, cache hit rates near 100%.

Measured data:

39 LLM rounds, same session — prompt **16k→40k**, hit rate **95–100%** (avg **98.7%**).

| Round | Prompt tokens | Cached tokens | Cache hit |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 16,176 | 15,872 | **98.1%** |
| 10 | 20,163 | 20,096 | **99.7%** |
| 20 | 27,604 | 26,624 | **96.4%** |
| 30 | 35,245 | 35,072 | **99.5%** |
| 39 | 39,794 | 39,552 | **99.4%** |

```

Environment overrides:

| Variable | Overrides |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `ALPHA_API_KEY` | `models[].api_key` (default model) |
| `ALPHA_MODEL` | `models[].name` (default model) |
| `ALPHA_BASE_URL` | `models[].base_url` (default model) |
| `ALPHA_SKILL_PATH` | `skill_path` |

Provider routing: a base URL containing `anthropic` or a model name starting
with `claude` uses the Anthropic Messages API; everything else uses the
OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` path.

### Workspace layout

```
~/.alpha/
├── config.yaml   # global configuration
├── bin/          # downloaded search tools (fd, ripgrep)
├── skills/       # SKILL.md skill directories
├── hooks/        # plugin.json + hook scripts
├── jobs/         # sub-agent job artifacts (meta, logs, result.md)
└── session/      # persisted sessions, one dir per working directory
    └── <encoded-cwd>/
```

## Interactive mode

`alpha` (or `alpha tui`) starts the TUI: a chat transcript on top, an editor at
the bottom, and a footer with the current activity. When a newer release is
available, the footer shows a hint like `0.2.0 available · alpha update`.

Assistant output is rendered as Markdown (CommonMark/GFM): headings, emphasis,
strikethrough, links, blockquotes, lists, task checkboxes, and tables are
styled with the active theme; fenced code blocks get a muted language caption and per-language
syntax highlighting. Structural markers (`#`, `` ` ``, `*`) are stripped.

The editor supports:

- `@` — fuzzy file mention picker (type `@` and start typing a path)
- `/` — slash command picker (`/sessions`, `/resume`, `/clear`, `/image`)
- `$` — skill picker (type `$` and start typing a skill name). Accepting inserts
  the literal `$name` token, so `$code-review the auth package` stays readable.
  The model loads that skill before it answers. Shell text such as `$HOME`,
  `${VAR}`, and `$5` does not open the picker.
- paste a screenshot path or **Ctrl+V** — attach a clipboard image to the next message (inline preview in Kitty/Ghostty)
- `!command` — run a shell command locally and stream its output into the
  transcript (see [Commands](#commands))
- `Ctrl+K` — command palette: settings → model / theme / permissions / agents, skills, hooks
- `Ctrl+R` / `Cmd+R` — session tree: pick a saved session to resume (same as `/sessions`)

### Keyboard shortcuts

Shortcuts accept `Ctrl` or `Cmd`, except where the table says otherwise.
`Ctrl` is the only option over SSH, inside tmux, and on Linux.

| Key | Action |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit alpha |
| `Esc` | Cancel stream / close pickers / close sub-agent view / detach |
| `Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+Shift+K` | Toggle the command palette |
| `Ctrl+R` / `Cmd+R` | Toggle the session tree dialog |
| `Ctrl+B` / `Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+T` | Toggle the TASKS sidebar (Ctrl+T if Ctrl+B is tmux) |
| `Ctrl+O` / `Cmd+O` | View selected/latest sub-agent transcript (popup) |
| `Ctrl+I` / `Cmd+I` | (in sub-agent view) steer — composer talks to that child |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | View the selected TASKS row (Ctrl only) |
| `Ctrl+V` | Attach an image from the clipboard (Ctrl only) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Cmd+C` | Copy the selected transcript text |

Terminals claim some `Cmd` combinations before alpha sees them. Ghostty, for
example, binds `Cmd+K` to clear the screen, `Cmd+T` to open a tab, `Cmd+Enter`
to toggle fullscreen, and `Cmd+V` to paste. Actions on those keys keep a `Ctrl`
binding, and the palette uses `Cmd+Shift+K` as its `Cmd` form.

Run `alpha keys` to see what your terminal delivers. A key that prints nothing
was consumed by the terminal.

Themes: `Dark`, `Darcula`, `Pink`, and `Terminal` (default), switchable from
the palette under settings → theme.

## Commands

| Command            | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `alpha` / `alpha tui`  | Start the interactive TUI                     |
| `alpha run -p "…"`   | Run one agent loop headlessly (see below)     |
| `alpha update`       | Download and install the latest GitHub release |
| `alpha update --check` | Query the latest release without installing |
| `alpha sessions list`| List persisted sessions for this directory    |
| `alpha keys`         | Show how this terminal reports key presses    |
| `/sessions`        | Open the session tree to pick one (TUI)       |
| `/resume`          | Resume the latest session; `/resume <id>` for a specific one |
| `/clear`           | Start a fresh empty session (TUI)             |
| `/image`           | Attach clipboard image; `/image <path>` for a file |
| `!command`         | Run a shell command locally, stream output into the transcript; `Esc` cancels it |

In the TUI, `!command` runs locally via `bash -c` — outside the agent loop. It
doesn't count toward agent busy state, and the running command can be cancelled
with `Esc` without touching an in-flight agent turn.

## Sessions

Sessions persist automatically per working directory under
`~/.alpha/session/<encoded-cwd>/` as JSONL trajectories.

- `alpha sessions list` — list session id, mtime, and preview for the current
  directory
- `/sessions`, `Ctrl+R`, or `Cmd+R` in the TUI — open a tree dialog of saved sessions,
  grouped by project. The current project is expanded; the others are
  collapsed. Type to filter by preview text, session id, or project name.
  `↑`/`↓` move, `←`/`→` fold a project, `Enter` resumes, `Esc` closes.

  Picking a session from another project resumes it and warns that the session
  cwd differs. The working directory does not change.
- `/resume` — continue the latest session for this directory (`/resume <id>` for a prefix/id)
- `/clear` — start a fresh session (new id, empty transcript)
- `alpha run --session <id>` / `alpha run --continue-last` — resume headlessly

## Headless mode

```sh
alpha run -p "fix the failing test in internal/tools"
```

Runs one agent loop without a TUI. Human logs go to stderr; with `--jsonl`,
machine-readable events go to stdout, one JSON object per line.

Flags:

| Flag                 | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --prompt STRING`| Prompt to run (required)                       |
| `--jsonl`            | Emit JSONL events to stdout                    |
| `--yolo`             | Skip all permission checks for this run (benchmarks / CI only) |
| `--max-rounds N`     | Cap tool rounds (default 64)                   |
| `--timeout DURATION` | Limit the agent run wall-clock time (e.g. `10m`; disabled by default) |
| `--session ID`       | Resume a persisted session by id or unique prefix |
| `--continue-last`    | Resume the newest persisted session for this directory |
| `--session-dir DIR`  | Override the session storage directory         |

Exit codes: `0` success · `1` runtime/LLM error · `2` max rounds reached ·
`3` config/usage error.

In the interactive TUI, exhausting the tool-round budget prompts Continue /
Stop. Headless `alpha run` has no confirmation UI, so it exits with code 2.

In headless mode, permission `ask` decisions are denied (there is no approval
UI), so `readonly`-style safety applies without extra flags. For benchmarks
that need arbitrary shell (`pytest`, `npm test`, …), pass `--yolo` to skip the
permission gate for that run only.

## Skills

Skills are directories containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and
a Markdown body. They are loaded from `~/.alpha/skills/` (or `skill_path` /
`ALPHA_SKILL_PATH`) and injected into the agent's context, letting you give the
model reusable procedures:

```markdown
---
name: My Skill
 description: What this skill does
license: MIT
compatibility: claude, openai
---
Instructions the agent should follow when this skill is relevant.
```

In the TUI, add skills from the palette (skills → list), then submit the
message with the selected skills applied.

## Permissions

Tool execution is gated by a permission policy, so the agent can run read-only
by default and ask before anything destructive. Configure it under
`permissions:` in `~/.alpha/config.yaml`.

Modes:

| Mode               | Behavior                                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `interactive`      | Default. `ask` decisions prompt in the TUI.         |
| `readonly`         | Deny writes / bash; read tools still work.          |
| `autopilot`        | Fold `ask` → allow, run unattended.                 |
| `headless-strict`  | Fold `ask` → deny (used by `alpha run`).              |

Per-tool rules: `bash.default` / `bash.allow` / `bash.deny` (exact command
prefix matching). Global keys:
`workspace_only_writes` (default true), `ask_timeout_sec`, and
`dangerously_allow_all` (default false).

In the TUI, an approval dialog replaces the editor with options to approve,
deny with feedback, or allow all for the session / for every session. The
palette's settings → permissions entry toggles session-wide bypass.

## Hooks

Hooks run custom logic around each tool call — before the permission gate and
after execution. Use them for organization policy, audit trails, or rewriting
tool input, without changing alpha's binary or `config.yaml`.

Each plugin is a directory under `hooks/` with `plugin.json` next to its
executables:

```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "name": "guard-bash",
      "event": "pre_tool",
      "match": "bash",
      "run": "./run.sh",
      "fail_closed": true
    },
    {
      "name": "review",
      "event": "command",
      "run": "./review.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

Hooks load from `~/.alpha/hooks/` and `<cwd>/.alpha/hooks/`; a project hook with
the same name replaces the user hook. `event: "command"` registers a TUI slash
command (`/name` runs that script). In the TUI, list or reload them via
`Ctrl+K` → hooks. In `readonly` permission mode, only `fail_closed` hooks run
so slow audit hooks don't stall exploration. Full guide:
[doc/hooks.md](doc/hooks.md).

## MCP

**Configure 100 MCP servers. Pay ~0 schema tokens until you call one.**

Most MCP hosts dump every `tools/list` schema into the model context before
you ask a question — browser stacks alone can burn 50k+ tokens. alpha does not.

Instead the agent gets three meta-tools, and the system prompt lists configured **server names** (no schemas):

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `mcp_list` | List tool **names** on one server (compact text) |
| `mcp_inspect` | Fetch a slim parameter summary for one tool |
| `mcp_call` | Run `server` + `tool` + `args` |

Flow: pick a server from the prompt → `mcp_list(server=…)` → `mcp_inspect` → `mcp_call`. Subprocesses start **lazily** on first use.
Calls still go through PreHooks → Gate / Ask → Run → PostHooks.

```sh
alpha mcp add browsermcp -- npx @browsermcp/mcp@latest
alpha mcp doctor
# In the TUI, the model can use configured servers without guessing MCP exists
```

Config: `~/.alpha/mcp.json` (project `<cwd>/.alpha/mcp.json` overrides by name).
Disable with `ALPHA_MCP=off`. Stdio and HTTP in v1.

Full guide: [doc/mcp.md](doc/mcp.md).

## Sub-agents

Sub-agent tools (`agent_spawn`, `agent_wait`, …) are **on by default**. To
keep a session lean, disable them in `~/.alpha/config.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  enabled: false
```

Or toggle for the current session via the palette: settings → agents.
When disabled, those tools are not registered and the model cannot spawn jobs.

Sub-agents themselves use a **role** (`explore` default | `review` | `worker`):

| Role | Tools | Use for |
| ------ | -------- | --------- |
| `explore` | read-only (+ allowlisted bash) | Search / map structure |
| `review` | read-only (+ allowlisted bash) | Diffs / checks; no edits |
| `worker` | full tools except nesting | Planned, independent edits |

Default stays explore (read-only). Prefer worker only after the parent has a concrete plan.

## Tools

Built-in tools the model can call (see `internal/tools/`):

| Tool           | Purpose                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `bash`         | Run a shell command in the working directory |
| `read`         | Read a file                                  |
| `write`        | Write a file (gated by permissions)          |
| `edit`         | Targeted edit of a file                      |
| `grep`         | Regex search across files                    |
| `find`         | File patterns (fd)                           |
| `ls`           | Directory listing                            |
| `read_image`   | Look at a local image or `https://` URL      |
| `skill`        | Load a SKILL.md by name                      |
| `webfetch`     | Fetch an https URL as text (SSRF-gated)      |
| `websearch`    | Web search (native provider, else DuckDuckGo)|
| `agent_spawn`  | Start an isolated sub-agent job (async)      |
| `agent_wait`   | Wait for a job; returns short summary only   |
| `agent_list`   | List jobs                                    |
| `agent_cancel` | Cancel a running job                         |

Sub-agent transcripts live under `~/.alpha/jobs/<id>/` and are **not** injected
into the parent context — only the wait/task summary is.

Fast search tools (`fd`, `ripgrep`) are downloaded on first startup into
`~/.alpha/bin` when missing.
