# Alpha

Minimal Go terminal coding-agent harness. Layout: [doc/project-layout.md](doc/project-layout.md). Humans: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Communication Preferences

- Dry, concise, low-key humor. No flattery, no forced memes. Skip preambles and postambles.
- Comments explain "why", not "what". English only — this repo was migrated off Chinese comments.
- Error messages: actionable and specific. No vague "something went wrong".

## Constraints

- **Tool loop is PreHooks → Gate/Ask → Run → PostHooks.** Don't bypass the permission gate when changing the executor. Don't put MCP server tool schemas on the model — only `mcp_list` / `mcp_inspect` / `mcp_call`.
- **Keep hashline `edit`.** Don't replace it with whole-file rewrite. Stale `@file path#TAG` / `LINE#HASH` must fail closed.
- **Sub-agent transcripts stay under `~/.alpha/jobs/<id>/`.** Parent context gets the wait/task summary only. Child engines have no `agent_*` tools (no nesting). Default child role is explore (read-only). The TUI **views** a child in a popup (Ctrl+O); **steer** (Ctrl+I) is opt-in attach. Don't swap the parent `Controller.engine` pointer — route through the child hub.
- **UI split:** `internal/components` render; `internal/tui` wires the shell. Non-shell pieces live under `internal/tui/controller` (Engine/Bus/Msg), `internal/tui/transcript` (Mapper); version in `internal/version`. Keep widgets dumb.
- **TUI assembly:** `cmd` constructs `controller.Bus` / `controller.Controller` / App / `commands.NewBuiltinRegistry()` and passes them into `editor.NewEditor(...)`. Do not hide `GetDefaultProject` inside `tui` constructors; do not return half-initialized Controllers (`engineErr` zombies). Prefer constructor parameters over `XxxDeps` bags.
- **Stay lean.** Direct module deps are few on purpose. Don't add a dependency without a clear need.
- **Go extensions** live under `internal/ext/<name>` and `ext.Register` in `init`. Wire new ones with a blank import in `cmd/plugins.go`. Do not add a `.so` plugin loader.
- **Format with `make fmt`** (gofumpt / goimports / golines, 120 cols, local prefix `github.com/rapatel0/alpha`). Don't hand-fight import groups.
- **`testing` / `testify` stay in `*_test.go`.** `depguard` will fail the lint otherwise.
- After dependency changes: `go mod tidy`. `go.mod` is not generated.

## Contributor Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and reviewable. Add or update tests next to the code.
- Conventional Commits, English, lowercase, imperative, ≤72 chars. One logical change per commit.
- Do not put `@mentions` or `fixes #...` in commit messages (those belong in the PR).
- Do not add `Co-authored-by:`.
- User-visible changes update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]`. Only release PRs
  move entries under `<!-- Released section -->` (requires `Unlock Released Changelog`).
  Skip with `Skip Changelog` / `dependencies` / `[chore]` in the PR title when no entry is needed.

## Commands

Toolchain is pinned in `mise.toml` (`mise install`). `make` still works if Go and golangci-lint are already on PATH.

```
mise run check                 # fmt-check + lint + test
mise run test                  # go test ./...
mise run fmt                   # apply formatters
mise run fmt-check             # CI formatting gate
mise run lint                  # golangci-lint
mise run build                 # ./alpha
go test ./internal/hooks -v    # one package
```

## Style

- Packages: lowercase, single word, match the directory (`writetool`, not `write_tool`).
- Prefer small packages under `internal/`; keep the exported surface small.
- Tests live beside the code they cover.
